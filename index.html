<h3>These two domains are for sale:</h3>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;1. I do not have capacity to build a business around them.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;2. I simply just prefer proceeds from sale.<br>
<br>
I plan to share this offer with the companies listed on the <a href="https://opentimestamps.org/">OpenTimestamps</a> website as well as other law firms specialising in technology.

<h3>Background info</h3>
Back in a day I was trying to solve a problem.<br>
<br>
But I couldn't figure it out.<br>
<br>
<a href="https://github.com/alex/what-happens-when">What happens when you type "G"?</a><br>
<br>
So many moving parts, too many dependencies. I do not trust my hardware, ISP, DNS, and other 3&#8209;letter agencies. If I do not trust what I see on the screen, why would anyone else trust me?<br>
<br>
Since then <i>(check my <a href="ftp-server.png">FTP server</a> and <a href="https://who.is/whois/legalscreenshot.com">who.is</a> data)</i> technology has moved on, Bitcoin and related cryptography are achieving mainstream adoption, now we have established standards:<br>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;â€¢ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_Existence">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_Existence</a><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;â€¢ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenTimestamps">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenTimestamps</a><br>

</p>

<h3>Now another standard is being established</h3>

<p><strong>"Archive.org's Wayback Machine is legit legal evidence, US appeals court judges rule."</strong></p>

<p>Here is <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/09/04/wayback_machine_legit/">the article</a>, <a href="https://forums.theregister.co.uk/forum/all/2018/09/04/wayback_machine_legit/">comments</a> and related <a href="https://regmedia.co.uk/2018/09/04/wayback-machine-gasperini-second-circuit.pdf">court of appeals judgement</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Prosecution had included testimony from the Internet Archive's office manager, who explained how the Archive captures and preserves evidence of the contents of the internet at a given time.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The court decided this provided "sufficient proof" that its mirrored pages were authentic.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Gasperini was free to cross-examine the witness about the nature and reliability of the Archiveâ€™s procedures for capturing and cataloguing the contents of the internet at particular times, and the jury was thus enabled to make its own decision about the weight, if any, to be given to the records. Accordingly, a sufficient basis was laid to place the admission of the evidence well within the discretion of the district court, and Gasperiniâ€™s challenge therefore fails.</blockquote>

<p>I just won the 1st prize at the Gitcoin <a href="https://github.com/kleros/hackathon/issues/1">hackathon</a> integrating a new <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1497">evidence standard</a> based on <a href="https://kleros.io/">Kleros</a> - it is pretty cool, check them out, solid game-theory incentives in play.<br>
<br>
I may accidently buidl something based on <a href="https://archive.org/services/docs/api/">archive.org API</a> + IPFS + OpenTimestamps.<br>

A life-changing amount would be $100k.

An amount that would make me extremely happy is $50k.

Realistically speaking $20k is already a lot and I will say "YES" with no regrets.

PLEASE NOTE: these are crypto bear market fugures. If there is another crypto explosion please multiply by ___

I live in an expensive city like London, working as "Innovation Engineer" in a Fortune 500 company, I would like to have enough money for a downpayment deposit to buy a house (with a south facing garden) in suburbs, truly become corporate wageslave cubicle commuter, have beer and watch Netflix after work, having too little energy to spent time with kids who have been to a government indoctrination camp all day.
